# '''✓''' [[User:jprvita]] (João Paulo Rechi Vita): I'm a developer of the QtWebkit project and have personal interest on writing a smart-tv platform with media center control capabilities and an integrate webbrowser that could be attached to any regular TV. The Raspberry Pi is an ideal hardware platform for that because of its reduced size and HDMI + RCA video jack and audio jack, and Qt with QtWebkit is the ideal software platform for this project. The project will be released under an open source license so anyone with a Raspberry Pi will be able to use it at home. Also, since there will be a graphical designer working with me on this project it will serve as an awesome showcase for Qt5 on embedded devices.
# [[User:mhoff]] I have senior experience in development of embedded uC devices. Driver development, touchscreen integration, hardware addons, network communication/protocols etc.. Want to bring Ethernet/IP stack http://opener.sourceforge.net to it to integrate with Allen Bradley PLCs - I have deep knowledge on this protocol and the PLC controllers. Qt5 could spend the Web based front end for this. Would also like to support education on embedded devices with an all in one place tutorial and guiding document how to develop embedded with IDEs like Eclipse and QTCreator, extending kernel with new drivers. Adapt QEMU to speedup development and simplify testing and debugging capabilities. Develop user space applications with QT based rich clients as well as WEB client applications. Seeing Raspberry PI with Qt as an ideal candidate for enabling a broad audience for embedded devices development.

#'''✓* [[User:unormal|unormal]] (Mario Fux). Idea: Short: WiktionaryParser with QML frontend (later dbpedia frontend). Longer: Wiktionary as the source of free linguistic date is unstructured in itself and thus we need some parser to extract the data and store it (probably semantically annotated). But there is a huge amount of date in different languages, perfect for school and education and simple to add new information. dbpedia is a similar approach for the Wikipedia data. Experience: I'm a teacher, studying education, computer sciences and computational linguistics (for which I do the WiktionaryParser [1]).

It’s visual and I think kids will go for it. My plan is to create an up to date LOGO interpreter but with an added challenge mode. Level 1, draw a line. Level 2, draw a square. Level 3, equilateral triangle. Slowly graduating them onto doing more complex patterns and shapes using functions, looping and recursion. With a free draw mode there is scope for users sharing content with each other and all sorts of good things. The app could also be ported to mobile phones to reach even more people thanks to the Qt framework. About myself; principally I am a Microsoft .Net framework /Javascript/Ajax/jQuery developer. I work in a UK based software consultancy (http://www.arcsoftwareconsultancy.com/), clients include Universal Music (USA and Japan), The Royal College of Psychiatrists (London) and the Wellcome Institute (London).

# [[User:vdvoskin]] Hello, my name is Vadim Dvoskin – I’m an entrepreneur as well as a Qt developer. One of my projects is a content service (video + flash games), available via a set-top-box (checkout this link http://3vi.tv/). Currently, the hardware we are using is way too expensive. In addition to that, it’s PC architecture (I lied before when I said that it was a set-top-box ;)), thus, we are having trouble certifying the solution with security authorities such as verimetrix, and securemedia. Raspberry PI is exactly what we are looking for because its ARM, its linux ''qt (which is what we are on now and not planning to switch), and its relatively inexpensive. Given a Raspberry PI hardware, my developers and I would work on two things. 1. A VOD video player. 2. Webkit based browser used as a flash player. Also, in subsequent releases, we are planning to add social services such as video chat.

The needs of the Indian audience being different in terms of user interface, apps used - for education, browser, book keeping, m-commerce, music - would be interesting to "focus on design" (keeping in mind Indian needs) and implement these; feasibility to use Qt 5 (specially QML) would be quite handy in developing/prototyping various local interfaces. The core idea is to make Indian people use this device in their daily life instead of personal computers.

This opportunity will help me get acquiented with the inner workings of QT5, its vision and direction. I would work on enabling easy access to interactive apps on this platform. The practical results would be lowering the entry bar for interactive applications with this HW/SW combo, examples: - My camera/projection based game: http://www.vpong.com/ - I belive the hardware is just powerfull enough for most interactive cases, another example: http://www.peauproductions.com/blog/2011/10/19/consulting-job-gagarin-circular-touch-table/ (quite elaborate, multiple devices could be used for analysis/display and the network coordination that comes with it) Summary: better integration possibilities for interactivity new ideas, maybe additional APIs/Libraries and examples. p.s. Sound analysis/voice recognition, TV "smarttening" box (TM:), "Tablet" type easy consumption devices

# '''✓''' [[User:trilion99]] (Klaus Petersen):I would like to use the Raspberry Pi and its Qt extension for two purposes: 1. As a small, light-weight frontend interface for my anthropomorphic flute playing robot WF-4RVI [http://www.takanishi.mech.waseda.ac.jp/top/research/music/flute/wf_4rv/index.htm]. The robot already runs on qt4 (e.g. qthread for motor control threads, gui for pattern generator etc.), so it would be convenient to port parts of the interface directly to an external control device. 2. In my company LP-Research [http://www.lp-research.com] we develop miniature sensing units for human motion tracking. For the analysis of the resulting data and control of the sensors itself we developed an open-source framework OpenMAT. This framework uses qt4 extensively. Customers would like to use our system on mobile, small form factor devices as well. The Raspberry Pi would be an excellent platform for such a data-logger / terminal.

Mentored by [[User:claudiar|Claudia Rauch]].

This is a special allocation of 10 boards agreed with the KDE project.— Qgil 15:04, 24 February 2012 (CET)

#'''✓* [[User:claudiar|Claudia Rauch]]: KDE proposes to use Raspberry PI devices to further an already considerable commitment to Qt. In particular, Qt5 has been integral to planning the future KDE core architecture, as Qt has been since KDE started. The KDE Project has a core goal to be widely deployable, just as Qt itself is. It would be advantageous and motivational for developers and students to hack on Raspberry PIs, providing them access to a new range of devices and a simple, portable, leading edge platform for Qt development. We will use the Raspberry PIs for coding tutorials to encourage new KDE and Qt developers. They will also be used withexisting KDE/Qt developers to promote Qt5 development on low-end devices. There are also opportunities to promote Qt, Raspberry PI and KDE to general audiences. Specifically, we request Raspberry PIs for use in a Qt/KDE workshop from 26 to 30 March 2012. This workshop will be held in Tallinn, Estonia to promote Qt and Akademy, KDE’s annual world summit (30th June - 6th July in Tallinn). Following the pre-Akademy workshop, the machines will be used for additional tutorials and workshops, application development and testing, Qt/KDE demos and promotion, and developer recruiting.

=== Marketing ===
People selected in this area is expected to help writing blogs and publishing videos of projects listed above. They are also meant to take any opportunities to present and demo Qt 5 projects running on the Raspberry Pi in events. If this is not what you had in mind contact me, please.— Qgil 02:29, 9 December 2011 (CET)
