<span class="co2">#'''✓* [[User:claudiar|Claudia Rauch]]: KDE proposes to use Raspberry PI devices to further an already considerable commitment to Qt. In particular, Qt5 has been integral to planning the future KDE core architecture, as Qt has been since KDE started. The KDE Project has a core goal to be widely deployable, just as Qt itself is. It would be advantageous and motivational for developers and students to hack on Raspberry PIs, providing them access to a new range of devices and a simple, portable, leading edge platform for Qt development. We will use the Raspberry PIs for coding tutorials to encourage new KDE and Qt developers. They will also be used withexisting KDE/Qt developers to promote Qt5 development on low-end devices. There are also opportunities to promote Qt, Raspberry PI and KDE to general audiences. Specifically, we request Raspberry PIs for use in a Qt/KDE workshop from 26 to 30 March 2012. This workshop will be held in Tallinn, Estonia to promote Qt and Akademy, KDE’s annual world summit (30th June - 6th July in Tallinn). Following the pre-Akademy workshop, the machines will be used for additional tutorials and workshops, application development and testing, Qt/KDE demos and promotion, and developer recruiting.</span>
